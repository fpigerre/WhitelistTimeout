Whitelist Timeout
=================

Whitelist Timeout is a bukkit plugin that removes players from a server whitelist if they have been inactive for more than fourteen days.

Whitelist timeout will initialize and remove players from a server whitelist when it loads, then disabled itself when it is done.
