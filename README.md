Whitelist Timeout [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/psgs/WhitelistTimeout.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/psgs/WhitelistTimeout)
=======================

Whitelist Timeout is a bukkit plugin that removes players from a server whitelist if they have been inactive for more than fourteen days.

Whitelist timeout will initialize and remove players from a server whitelist when the "/whitelist remove" command is executed. If a player has the "mapdev.staff" permission, that player won't be unwhitelisted.

This plugin was originally created for the [OresomeCraft Network!](http://oresomecraft.com)
